This is a project to showcase [Fermyon Spin](https://www.fermyon.com/spin), a framework for building and running fast, secure, and composable cloud microservices with WebAssembly.

It contains both a backend, with CORS support, built with [Spin](https://www.fermyon.com/spin), and a simple frontend built with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

The main goal of this repo is to showcase how easy it is to get started with [Fermyon Spin](https://www.fermyon.com/spin) and how powerful it is to create serverless WebAssembly apps. You can use your favorite language and connect your app to various data services, such as Redis, PostgreSQL, and more.

In this project, I will show you how to create a simple app [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and how to deploy it to the Fermyon Cloud with just a few commands. You will also learn how to use Spin triggers, templates, and components to simplify your development process.
